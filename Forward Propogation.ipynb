    "### Forward Propogation from Scratch: Linear Model for House Rent Prediction\n",
    "We want to determine the rent of a house based on one variable: `number of rooms`. Intuitively, we know that the rent of a house is not solely dependent on the number of rooms present in the house so any model we make using just this one variable will not be a very good one. But let's start with this right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear model for determining the house rent will look like:\n",
    "$$ Rent = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 X $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will ignore the first coefficient $\\theta_0$ (y-intercept) for this process and just examine the remaining equation."
